[3] For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses\u2014as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. [4] (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) [5] Now Moses was faithful in all God\u2019s house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, [6] but Christ is faithful over God\u2019s house as a son. And we are his house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.(3)\n\nA Rest for the People of God\n\n  [7] Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,\n\n    \u201cToday, if you hear his voice,\n    [8] do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,\n        on the day of testing in the wilderness,\n    [9] where your fathers put me to the test\n        and saw my works for forty years.\n    [10] Therefore I was provoked with that generation,\n    and said, \u2018They always go astray in their heart;\n        they have not known my ways.\u2019\n    [11] As I swore in my wrath,\n        \u2018They shall not enter my rest.\u2019\u201d\n    \n    \n      [12] Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. [13] But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called \u201ctoday,\u201d that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. [14] For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. [15] As it is said,\n\n    \u201cToday, if you hear his voice,\n    do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.\u201d\n    \n    \n      [16] For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? [17] And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? [18] And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? [19] So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 3:1 Or *brothers and sisters*; also verse 12\n\n(2) 3:2 Greek *his*; also verses 5, 6\n\n(3) 3:6 Some manuscripts insert *firm to the end*\n (ESV)"]}
