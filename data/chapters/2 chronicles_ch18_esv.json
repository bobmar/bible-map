[2] After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. [3] Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, \u201cWill you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?\u201d He answered him, \u201cI am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.\u201d\n\n  [4] And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \u201cInquire first for the word of the LORD.\u201d [5] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, \u201cShall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?\u201d And they said, \u201cGo up, for God will give it into the hand of the king.\u201d [6] But Jehoshaphat said, \u201cIs there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?\u201d [7] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cThere is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil.\u201d And Jehoshaphat said, \u201cLet not the king say so.\u201d [8] Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, \u201cBring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.\u201d [9] Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them. [10] And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, \u201cThus says the LORD, \u2018With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.\u2019\u201d [11] And all the prophets prophesied so and said, \u201cGo up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph. The LORD will give it into the hand of the king.\u201d\n\n  [12] And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, \u201cBehold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.\u201d [13] But Micaiah said, \u201cAs the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak.\u201d [14] And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, \u201cMicaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?\u201d And he answered, \u201cGo up and triumph; they will be given into your hand.\u201d [15] But the king said to him, \u201cHow many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?\u201d [16] And he said, \u201cI saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, \u2018These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.\u2019\u201d [17] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cDid I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?\u201d [18] And Micaiah said, \u201cTherefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. [19] And the LORD said, \u2018Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?\u2019 And one said one thing, and another said another. [20] Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, \u2018I will entice him.\u2019 And the LORD said to him, \u2018By what means?\u2019 [21] And he said, \u2018I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.\u2019 [22] Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets. The LORD has declared disaster concerning you.\u201d\n\n  [23] Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, \u201cWhich way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?\u201d [24] And Micaiah said, \u201cBehold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.\u201d [25] And the king of Israel said, \u201cSeize Micaiah and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king\u2019s son, [26] and say, \u2018Thus says the king, Put this fellow in prison and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.\u2019\u201d [27] And Micaiah said, \u201cIf you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.\u201d And he said, \u201cHear, all you peoples!\u201d\n\nThe Defeat and Death of Ahab\n\n  [28] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. [29] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cI will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.\u201d And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle. [30] Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, \u201cFight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.\u201d [31] As soon as the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, \u201cIt is the king of Israel.\u201d So they turned to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; God drew them away from him. [32] For as soon as the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. [33] But a certain man drew his bow at random(1) and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, \u201cTurn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.\u201d [34] And the battle continued that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. Then at sunset he died.\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 18:33 Hebrew *in his innocence*\n (ESV)"]}
