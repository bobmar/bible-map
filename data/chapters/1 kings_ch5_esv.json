[2] And Solomon sent word to Hiram, [3] \u201cYou know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. [4] But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune. [5] And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to David my father, \u2018Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.\u2019 [6] Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.\u201d\n\n  [7] As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, \u201cBlessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.\u201d [8] And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, \u201cI have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. [9] My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household.\u201d [10] So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired, [11] while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors(2) of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000(3) cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. [12] And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.\n\n  [13] King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men. [14] And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft. [15] Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country, [16] besides Solomon\u2019s 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. [17] At the king\u2019s command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. [18] So Solomon\u2019s builders and Hiram\u2019s builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 5:1 Ch 5:15 in Hebrew\n\n(2) 5:11 A *cor* was about 6 bushels or 220 liters\n\n(3) 5:11 Septuagint; Hebrew *twenty*\n (ESV)"]}
