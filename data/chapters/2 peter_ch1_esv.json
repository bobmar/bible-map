[5] For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue,(5) and virtue with knowledge, [6] and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, [7] and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. [8] For if these qualities(6) are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. [9] For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. [10] Therefore, brothers,(7) be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. [11] For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\n  [12] Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have. [13] I think it right, as long as I am in this body,(8) to stir you up by way of reminder, [14] since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. [15] And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.\n\nChrist\u2019s Glory and the Prophetic Word\n\n  [16] For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. [17] For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, \u201cThis is my beloved Son,(9) with whom I am well pleased,\u201d [18] we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. [19] And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, [20] knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone\u2019s own interpretation. [21] For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 1:1 Some manuscripts *Simon*\n\n(2) 1:1 For the contextual rendering of the Greek word *doulos*, see Preface\n\n(3) 1:3 Or *by*\n\n(4) 1:3 Or *virtue*\n\n(5) 1:5 Or *excellence*; twice in this verse\n\n(6) 1:8 Greek *these things*; also verses 9, 10, 12\n\n(7) 1:10 Or *brothers and sisters*.
